    # sensors commands, but you cannot change the current
    # command parameters for the actuators (motors, speaker,
    # lights, low side drivers, digital outputs) to something else.
    # To change how one of the actuators operates, you must
    # switch from Passive mode to Full mode or Safe mode.

    # When you send a Safe command to the OI, Create enters into
    # Safe mode. Safe mode gives you full control of Create, with
    # the exception of the following safety-related conditions:
    # • Detection of a cliff while moving forward (or moving
    # backward with a small turning radius, less than one robot
    # radius).
    # • Detection of a wheel drop (on any wheel).
    # • Charger plugged in and powered.
    # Should one of the above safety-related conditions occur
    # while the OI is in Safe mode, Create stops all motors and
    # reverts to the Passive mode.
    # If no commands are sent to the OI when in Safe mode, Create
    # waits with all motors and LEDs off and does not respond to
    # Play or Advance button presses or other sensor input.
    # Note that charging terminates when you enter Safe Mode.

    # Full mode, Create executes any command that you send
    # it, even if the internal charger is plugged in, or the robot
    # senses a cliff or wheel drop.

    # When you send a Full command to the OI, Create enters
    # into Full mode. Full mode gives you complete control over
    # Create, all of its actuators, and all of the safety-related
    # conditions that are restricted when the OI is in Safe mode,
    # as Full mode shuts off the cliff, wheel-drop and internal
    # charger safety features. To put the OI back into Safe mode,
    # you must send the Safe command.
    # If no commands are sent to the OI when in Full mode, Create
    # waits with all motors and LEDs off and does not respond to
    # Play or Advance button presses or other sensor input.
